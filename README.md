This is the code repository for the paper "A Data-Driven Approach for Optimizing Early-Stage Electric Vehicle Charging Station Placement" in Transactions on Industrial Informatics.

### Reference 
C. Sun, T. Li and X. Tang, ["A Data-Driven Approach for Optimizing Early-Stage Electric Vehicle Charging Station Placement,"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10045802) in IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, doi: 10.1109/TII.2023.3245633.

### data
The POI data and the population data for the city of Haikou are provided. 
* The population data is from Worldpop (https://www.worldpop.org).
* The trajectory data was from DIDI (https://gaia.didichuxing.com), but no longer publicly available. Due to the permissions requirements , we cannot provide the data. 



### code 
Due to data permission requirements, we provide the implementation of the proposed approach for two settings (delta-nearest model and K-nearest model) using only population data. 


### Requirement 
* numpy
* pandas
